Overview
My project will be a dive log that allows users to track the gear they wore. Information specific to the dive depth, duration,psi in and out, visibility, air temp, surface temp and bottom temp, the type of dive, nitrogen saturation in and out cumulative dive counter and hours counter. Users will be able to create an account, sign in, create, edit, remove dives. They will be able to view an account page that shows their dives in a list and has a total cumulative dives and total cumulative hours.
I decided to make this project because I love to scuba dive. Unfortunately, I have taken a 7 year break. I no longer have my cumulative hours or dives because it was on paper. I cannot apply to take a dive master certification course because a requirement is to have 40 logged dives. This application would be beneficial to anyone who doesn't want to loose their progress as a diver. It can also help people plan future dives based on their own previous experiences at a location.

Features
User Sign up: Users will be able to create a new profile for themselves, allowing them to track their own dives, based on their own logs.
User Login: Users will be able to login after creating a profile. Users will be able to create new logs, edit and delete.
View User account, this view will show a list of dives, titles will be the date of the dive, it will have a cumulative dive counter and a cumulative duration.
Will have a sort feature that allows a sort by visibility, type of water (fresh/salt), type of dive (beach, boat), scale 1-5 of how many fish.
If time allows I will work in a map that shows the different locations of the dive spots.
Technologies
spring boot
Java
CSS
MAMP/mySQL
What I'll Have to Learn
How to put the map in the application. I'm going to have to dig deeper into CSS to make this form appealing to the eye because I will have so many user inputs.
